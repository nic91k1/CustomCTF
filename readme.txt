npx create-react-app ctf-frontend
cd ctf-frontend
npm install axios react-router-dom


Run front end:

npm start

Make sure the backend is running on http://localhost:5000.
Open the React app in the browser (http://localhost:3000).

All written with JS and Python with some CSS for styling. The Front and Back end are deployed seperately and the backend must be in a virtual
environment.
